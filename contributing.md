Pull requests are always welcome and respected. Cosmetic code things are never blockers.

Please open an issue to ask questions before making a big PR, that changes behaviour or adds new features.

### To make a PR
* login with your GitHub account or [create an account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) for you
* [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the current `wtf_wikipedia` repository
```bash
npm install
npm test
```
* make your changes in `./src` (optionally, work on them with `npm run watch` and ./scratch.js)
* make sure the tests still pass `npm test`
* for bonus points - add a few tests in `./tests` (doesn't matter where) for the new behaviour
* create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/) for the maintainers to integrate the work into the dev or master branches

don't worry about incrementing package numbers, or kicking-off builds. Releases will be handled by the maintainers.

Lastly, thank you! Understanding the information in wikipedia is serious and important project.

It's done collaboratively or not at all!
