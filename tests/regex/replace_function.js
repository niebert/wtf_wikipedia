The club was founded in 1916 and experienced its first coverage in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on March 16, 1916.<ref>Wells, p. 6.</ref>  It had office space in the [[Fine Arts Building (Chicago)|Fine Arts Building]] that became too limiting to serve the club's mission.  In 1918, the club elected Rue Winterbotham Carpenter to replace Mrs. Robert McGann as president.  She moved the club to 610 South [[Michigan Avenue (Chicago)|Michigan Avenue]] .<ref>Wells, p. 7.</ref>  The first exhibition included portraits by [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler|Whistler]], [[Renoir]], [[Mary Cassatt|Cassatt]], [[August Johns]] and others.  By 1922, the club had outgrown its quarters and sponsored supplementary space at the Art Institute of Chicago until 1927 when the cost of doing so became prohibitive.  In 1924, the club moved to the north tower of the [[Wrigley Building]].<ref>Wells, p. 8.</ref>  Among its first exhibitions at the Wrigley building was the first major United States show (seventeen sculptures, nineteen drawings and a painting) of Brâncuși.  The show was installed by [[Marcel Duchamp]].<ref name="Wells, p. 9">Wells, p. 9.</ref>  Rue Carpenter died on December 7, 1931,<ref name="Wells, p. 9"/> and Mrs. Charles Goodspeed was elected president in 1932.<ref>Wells, p. 10.</ref>  The club moved to more spacious accommodations at the Wrigley Building in 1936.  "Bobsy" Goodspeed served as president until 1940.  Then, Rue Winterbotham Carpenter's niece Rue Winterbotham Shaw was elected President.<ref>Wells, p. 11.</ref> In 1947, the club scaled down its operations for four years after losing its Wrigley Building [[lease]].  In 1951, it moved to 109 East Ontario in quarters built to specification that were designed by [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]].<ref>Wells, p. 39.</ref>  Using Arts Club furniture, he designed a gallery, dining room, and lecture hall in a pre-existing building.  The gallery was built around [[Constantin Brâncuși]]'s ''[[The Golden Bird (Brâncuși sculpture)|The Golden Bird]]'' and the stairway was renowned for its simple elegance.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Architecture and Design|author1=Pridmore, Jay  |author2=George A.

===1990s - new building===
In the 1990s, the club was located west of Michigan Avenue and behind the 620 building which was home to many of Chicago's finest [[art dealer]]s including Richard Gray and Richard L. Feigen & Co. The Arts club did not own the land upon which their famous Mies clubhouse was built; instead, the club held the land in a longterm [[lease]]hold. In 1990, the owner of 620 N. Michigan and the Arts Club land decided to sell. At first the Arts Club hoped to raise the money to purchase its land along with the 620 N. Michigan Avenue property in an effort spearheaded by Richard Gray, but it quickly became apparent that the club would lose a bidding war over this valuable land. A developer bought the property and demolished the entire block to make way for a movie complex and [[shopping center]].

With the prospect of losing its home, the Arts Club opted to sell one of the most valuable items in its collection to finance the purchase of new land. The club decided to sell Brâncuși's Bird to the Art Institute of Chicago.<ref>Shaw, p. 29.</ref> To finance the purchase, the Art Institute sold several second tier works from its famous [[Impressionist]] collection at [[Sotheby's]] in guaranteed lots which was a new concept in the [[auction]] world in 1990. While without permanent home, the club continued to meet regularly in space loaned by the Casino, another famous [[Near North Side, Chicago|Near North Side]] club.

The {{convert|19000|sqft|m2}} John Vinci designed building is a two-story structure that cost [[United States Dollar|$]]9 million for the land, building, [[landscaping]], and [[interior design]]. The exterior [[facade]] is buff [[brick]] with black [[granite]] windowsills and [[thresholds]] and white-painted [[steel]] windows.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/> The building features furniture dating back to the club's founding as well as Mies van der Rohe designs.<ref name=ACoCBFactSheet/>  Several elements of the new building's design are considered homages to Mies. The fact that the building was so Miesian thirty years after his death while the club focused on avant-gard art was a bit of a controversy.<ref>{{cite book|title=Chicago Architecture and Design|author1=Pridmore, Jay  |author2=George A. Larson |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=Harry N.

==Exhibitions, performances and lectures==
Until the [[Museum of Modern Art]] was founded in 1929, Chicago and The Arts Club in particular was the most receptive exhibitor of [[modern art]] in the United States.  At that time, no institution in the United States, especially none in Manhattan, would exhibit European [[modernism]].  By renting space at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]'s [[Art Institute of Chicago Building|Building]] the Arts Club was able to arrange showings in Chicago's most prestigious museum.<ref name=MM/>

The club has exhibited an impressive number of well-known 20th century [[visual artist]]s.  Many of the century's most controversial artists made their United States or [[midwest]] solo exhibition debuts at the club including: Alexander Calder, [[Marc Chagall]], [[Salvador Dalí]], [[Jean Dubuffet]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Jackson Pollock]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri Toulouse-Lautrec]]. In addition, many artists have given lectures at the Club, including [[Martha Graham]], [[Kathleen Battle]], [[Leonard Bernstein]], [[Kenneth Branagh]] and [[Robert Altman]]. Aside from visual artists, the Club also has hosted lectures and performances from such prominent musicians as [[John Cage]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Ramsey Lewis]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], and poets [[W. H. Auden]], [[Gertrude Stein]] and [[William Butler Yeats]].<ref name=ACoCFactSheet/>  Most notable among these exhibitions was Picasso's first United States solo exhibition,<ref name=MM>Fitzgerald, pp. 120-1</ref> ''Original Drawings by Pablo Picasso'' from March 20 to April 22, 1923,<ref>Shaw, pg. 123</ref> by the Arts Club at its installation at the Art Institute of Chicago. (Picasso's work had first been shown the US in a group show in New York curated by [[Edward Steichen]] in 1911.<ref name="MM-278">Fitzgerald, pp. 278</ref>)  In the 1930s, when [[Isamu Noguchi]] was still known as a sculptor, they hosted him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,744590,00.html|title=Third Noguchi|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=October 10, 1932|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>  In 1970 when [[Varujan Boghosian]] was a timely sculptor known for depicting the legend of [[orpheus]],  The Arts Club hosted a showing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,876579,00.html|title=The Mythmaker|accessdate=April 30, 2008|date=February 9, 1970|publisher=[[Time, Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}</ref>
